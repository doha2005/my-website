  <P>Hypertext Markup Language <b>(HTML)</b> is the standard markup language for documents designed to
     be displayed in a web browser. It defines the content and structure of web content.
      It is often assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets 
      <b>(CSS)</b> and scripting languages such as <b>JavaScript.</b> </P>

      <i><h2>Why we use HTML?</h2></i>
     <p><b>HTML</b> is used to provide structure to a webpage and make it accessible to users of the internet through text, 
        visual formatting and search factors. It is commonly known as the most basic building block of the web,
         working alongside CSS and JavaScript to create the websites we see while browsing.</p>
